            <title>[AVRO-1625] Adding Microsoft C# Implementation to the project</title>
                <link>https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1625</link>
                <project id="12310911" key="AVRO">Apache Avro</project>
                    <description>&lt;p&gt;In April 2014 Microsoft released to the public its own C# implementation of Avro. The code is completely new. The reasoning for the project was to overcome the limitations of C# implementation available as a component of Apache project at the time we have commenced the effort (early 2013). In particular:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Low performance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Missing support of serialization using Reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Our implementation is called Microsoft Avro Library and available here &lt;a href=&quot;https://hadoopsdk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Avro%20Library&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://hadoopsdk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Avro%20Library&lt;/a&gt; (together with the code)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2014 we have released some updates, fixed bugs, added a feature and now would like to start a conversation about contributing our library to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doug Cutting suggested I start a Jira issue for this conversation, so I&#8217;m following the advice (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/avro-dev/201406.mbox/%3c50937B33CDF7CA46AFCC1F1D04C6551A0A01B213@DB3EX14MBXC327.europe.corp.microsoft.com%3e&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/avro-dev/201406.mbox/%3c50937B33CDF7CA46AFCC1F1D04C6551A0A01B213@DB3EX14MBXC327.europe.corp.microsoft.com%3e&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background information on today&#8217;s state of the library:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;alternate&quot; type=&quot;square&quot;&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The library supports binary serialization only&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RPC support is NOT implemented&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The library is compiled vs Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0. We have NOT tested it on other platforms (e.g. with Mono).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And about me. I&#8217;m a Microsoft employee and Program Manager responsible for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking forward getting the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br/&gt;
Alexey&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Is your team planning on implementing JSON serialization?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regards,&lt;br/&gt;
Martin Sponholtz&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

&lt;p&gt;We don&apos;t have any confirmed plan for new feature development. Also at the moment we don&apos;t have any work in progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you,&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="14277045" author="davidtaylor" created="Wed, 14 Jan 2015 15:22:15 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to add your enhancements to the existing implementation?  Currently there are already two implementations (original and pre-resolving) within the existing C# library and now this would add a third in a separate library,  Perhaps you could add your performance enhancements to the existing pre-resolving implementation.  It would be nice to deprecate the original implementation as it is already confusing for new users to know which implementation to use.  Adding a completely new Avro library that does not even include a key feature available in the existing library (RPC) does not seem like a step forward.  Having a reflection based implementation would certainly be useful but could easily be built on top of the existing library.  I did so when integrating Avro into an existing home-grown serialization system.  Initially it was built on top of the generic implementation but was later enhanced to use the specific serializer although this did require some hacks to the existing library but performance was much improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to see from your description above what is compelling about your implementation compared to the existing C# library.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>

It would be awesome to see this within Apache Avro.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14980190" author="alexeyo" created="Thu, 29 Oct 2015 10:09:22 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;It was suggested to me lately that we reopen discussion on adding Microsoft C# Implementation to the project. The nature of implementation and further information is presented at the first description of this issue (&lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1625&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1625&lt;/a&gt;) So the feedback is welcome.&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you,&lt;br/&gt;

                            <comment id="14980791" author="rdblue" created="Thu, 29 Oct 2015 16:56:25 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Thanks for pinging this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=alexeyo&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;alexeyo&quot;&gt;Alexey Orlov&lt;/a&gt;! It would be great to have you guys work on this C# implementation with the Apache community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=davidtaylor&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;davidtaylor&quot;&gt;David Taylor&lt;/a&gt; makes a good point about needing to sort out the current implementations and how to integrate the new codebase with what is already there. Is anyone familiar with both? It sounds like we would want RPC support on top of the Microsoft implementation and then we could deprecate the current ones that aren&apos;t actively maintained. I think we would also want to make sure we build/test it with Mono to make our builds work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, we can plan integration moving forward in parallel with efforts to get the software donated to the foundation. The Incubator handles formalities around that process, but I think the main thing is going through the items in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/public/trunk/content/ip-clearance/ip-clearance-template.xml&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;IP clearance template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14982226" author="alexeyo" created="Fri, 30 Oct 2015 09:31:55 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Ryan, a short question on IP clearance template. What tool do you use to work with the template? Or do  you have it in a form more suitable for a Legal Department? (Rather ask these questions before proceeding with manual data extraction from xml)&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="14982811" author="rdblue" created="Fri, 30 Oct 2015 16:28:31 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;Sorry, that&apos;s not very readable! There&apos;s also a rendered &lt;a href=&quot;https://incubator.apache.org/ip-clearance/ip-clearance-template.html&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTML version of that template&lt;/a&gt;. That outlines the process that we need to go through and identifies steps like making sure the code has appropriate headers, the software grant is received, the code doesn&apos;t have any dependencies with incompatible licenses, ensuring your contributors have signed individual CLAs and that Microsoft has a corporate CLA with the Foundation, etc. It&apos;s a checklist for the whole process, which is usually completed by an Apache member or the Avro VP (which is &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?name=tomwhite&quot; class=&quot;user-hover&quot; rel=&quot;tomwhite&quot;&gt;Tom White&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your legal department, the next steps from the checklist are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Complete the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/software-grant.txt&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;software grant agreement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure you have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/cla-corporate.txt&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;CCLA on file&lt;/a&gt; (Microsoft may already)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ensure everyone that will continue contributing has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apache.org/licenses/icla.txt&quot; class=&quot;external-link&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ICLA on file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By far the main issue by us is that the people who originally made our implementation are currently heavily busy with other assignments. We&#8217;re asking some other colleagues to help but because of the projects schedule can&#8217;t rely on their availability earlier than January. In the meantime, if someone would like to get deeper into the code, we would gladly explain, what was done, how the code is organized, etc. Just ping me via this case or directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ryan, really sorry I can&apos;t push it faster. But I&apos;m doing the best I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and to emphasize one thing. The people who originally created our code are reachable and agree to provide support if someone would like to &quot;get deeper&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;</comment>
                            <comment id="15025237" author="rdblue" created="Tue, 24 Nov 2015 20:01:32 +0000"  >&lt;p&gt;No problem, Alexey. My motivation here is to build up the Avro community by working with you guys instead of on separate C# implementations. I&apos;m not trying to hit a schedule. I understand these things can take time and we want to make sure this happens in a way that everyone is happy with.&lt;/p&gt;</comment>
